Hey Marius, thanks in advance for taking a look at my code!
I didn't get to test it at the meeting on Nov 1st, so hopefully you'll get a look at this and let me know if there is anything you need me to fix before testing.
I've made this repo public and added some README documentation (mostly so I don't confuse myself in the future), so don't worry about that part.
Thanks again!
