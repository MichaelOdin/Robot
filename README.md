# Robot
First attempt at writing every aspect of a robot's code, mostly from scratch. Started Oct 24, 2018. Intended to work with a Walton Robotics robot (FRC team 2974).

Minimum code necessary for teleop finished but not tested on Nov 1, 2018 (written over the course of a couple team meetings).

Uses ProjectSetup java file to download necessary files along with Gradle, which gives you the Robot.java file, from there you create the rest of the classes and folders manually. Referencing previous robot code may be helpful, although the code will inevitably be different and will use different methods and resources. 

TODO: test teleop code on working robot, write and test Straight Line auton code, write and test throttle limiter (get more detailed instructions for this)
